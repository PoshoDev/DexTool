### Tips & Additional Info:
- When you right click a Pokémon slot it will change its color. You can decide the meaning of each color, but I _(thy tool creator)_ use them as follows:
  | Color      	| Meaning                    	|
  |------------	|----------------------------	|
  | White      	| Not Obtained               	|
  | Red        	| In HOME                    	|
  | Blue       	| In HOME, but not organized 	|
  | Yellow     	| In Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee  	|
  | Light Blue 	| In Sword/Shield            	|
